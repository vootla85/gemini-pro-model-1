Generative AI





Supervised learning:It uses a label input and output data.ML algorithm are trained on labeled datasets
It divides in to two 
1) classification talk about output is a discrete class label like spam or not spam
examples are linear classifers, support vector machine, decision trees
2) Regression: the out put is a continous value such as price or probability.
examples are linear regression and logistic regression are common regression algorithm

Unsupervise learing: It uses a unlabel data: mlalgorithm are not really given any label at alland these algorithm discover hidden pattern in data without need for human invention.
examples are clustering,association,dimensionallty reduction
clustering-customer segmentation -Like similarties age, location, 
Association - this algorithm looks for relationship between the variable in data- market basket analysis- which items should brought together
dimensional reduction -the algorithm reduces the no of variables in data still preserving as much of infomationa as posssible. autoencode removes the noise from visual image to improve picture quality
