Generative AI





Supervised learning:It uses a label input and output data.ML algorithm are trained on labeled datasets
classifying big data can be real challenge in supervised learning and results are highly accurate.
It divides in to two 
1) classification talk about output is a discrete class label like spam or not spam
examples are linear classifers, support vector machine, decision trees
2) Regression: the out put is a continous value such as price or probability.
examples are linear regression and logistic regression are common regression algorithm

Unsupervise learing: It uses a unlabel data: mlalgorithm are not really given any label at alland these algorithm discover hidden pattern in data without need for human invention.
 Unsupervised model don't perdictic data there only group data together
 It can handle large volume of data set

Examples : clustering,association,dimensionallty reduction

Clustering-customer segmentation -Like similarties age, location
Association - this algorithm looks for relationship between the variable in data- market basket analysis- which items should brought together
Dimensional reduction -the algorithm reduces the no of variables in data still preserving as much of infomationa as posssible. autoencode removes the noise from visual image to improve picture quality


semi-supervised learning:training data set  with both labeled and unlabeled data
ideal for medical images, where small amount of training data could lead to significant improvement in accuracy.

Example: Radiologist can look at and label aome small subset of CT scan for tumor ofr diseases and then machine can more accuretlu predict which patient required more attention with out going through and labeling the entire set.
